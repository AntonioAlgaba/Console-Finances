# Console-Finances
## Description
In this poject I've created an algorithm for analyzing a finanacial dataset for a company

The company gave us a dataset from a few months and I have to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate the following:

  - Total Months: 
  - Total: 
  - Average  Change: 
  - Greatest Increase in Profits:
  - Greatest Decrease in Profits:

I have used for loop to iterate through the dataset(array) and if staments.
